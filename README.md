SpecifyR Concept Files

SpecifyR enhances BIM models at every stage of a project's lifestyle, by including specific information for parts and retaining design assumptions within the element in the model. Improving the now manual process to a transparent, well defined and AI-assisted toolkit to suggest regularly used products that meet design requirements. This results in the asset owner, contractor, designer and manufacturer to have a transparent, clearly defined scope which improves communications between stakeholders and the opportunity to automatically generate quotes, product/maintenance schedules and more for a project.
